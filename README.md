Vue.js Mixin: Google Maps Autocomplete for Addresses.

####Usage

This is a reusable [Vue.js Mixin](http://vuejs.org/api/#mixins) to help adding an address autocomplete feature using the Places library in the Google Maps JavaScript API.

Steps:

1. Add this mixin to any Vue.js instance or component
2. Get the DOM input element where you will be typing addresses, and assing it to a property named `googleAutoCompleteInput`
3. Create a method named `updateAddress`. In this method, you can assign the address values to your required properties. Check the example on `app.js`
